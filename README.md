# The AAS WorldWide Telescope WebGL engine

The “WebGL engine” of the [AAS] [WorldWide Telescope][wwt-home] (WWT) is a
JavaScript/[TypeScript] framework that powers the Web-based versions of the WWT
visualization software, as exemplified by the [WWT web client][webclient].

Learn more about WWT [here][wwt-home].

## Developers’ quick start

1. Check out this repository to a machine with [Node.js] and [npm].
1. `git submodule update --init`
1. `npx lerna bootstrap -- --legacy-peer-deps` (You may be able to omit
   the arguments here, depending on your version of NPM. See [this bug][vue6270].)
1. Either build or obtain the file `engine/wwtlib/bin/wwtlib.js` as described
   below.
1. `npm run lint` (uses [ESLint])
1. `npm run build` creates:
   1. The core engine package in the `engine/` package.
   1. The engine tidied up into a [Vue]/[Vuex] module in `engine-vuex/`
   1. The WWT embed app intended for iframe inclusion in `embed/`
   1. The WWT research app in `research-app/`
   1. The user-facing app for creating embed iframe code in `embed-creator/`
1. Commands to serve the web apps:
   1. `npm run serve-embed` to serve the embed app
   1. `npm run serve-research` to serve the research app
   1. `npm run serve-creator` to serve the embed creator app
1. `npm run test` (mainly uses [mocha] and [chai])
1. `npm run doc` (uses [TypeDoc])

## Repository structure

This repository is a [monorepo] containing the source for several interlocking
TypeScript packages that together comprise the core of the WWT web framework.
The most important subdirectories are:

[monorepo]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo

- `@wwtelescope/engine` in `engine/`, the core engine code transpiled from C# and
  wrapped in TypeScript annotations
- `@wwtelescope/engine-vuex` in `engine-vuex/`, a higher-level package that turns the
  engine into a reusable [Vue]/[Vuex] component
- `@wwtelescope/embed` in `embed/`, a web application that turns WWT into a
  configurable, embeddable iframe
- `@wwtelescope/research-app` in `research-app/`, an embeddable web application for
  astrophysics research using WWT.
- The narrative documentation in `docs/`

README files inside the individual subdirectories give more information about
their contents and development workflows.


## The `engine/wwtlib/bin/wwtlib.js` file

There’s one big wrinkle to the build process: the bulk of the engine code is
actually C# code in the directory `engine/wwtlib/`. It’s forked from
[wwt-windows-client] and is transpiled into JavaScript using an unreleased
version of [ScriptSharp], an unmaintained tool. Fortunately, that build process
results in a single file, `engine/wwtlib/bin/wwtlib.js`, that you can download
from our CI systems if you’re not able to perform a Visual Studio build.

[wwt-windows-client]: https://github.com/WorldWideTelescope/wwt-windows-client
[ScriptSharp]: https://github.com/nikhilk/scriptsharp

To build the engine library starting from C#:

1. You need a Windows machine with Visual Studio 2017. Other versions of Visual
   Studio might also work.
1. Open the `engine/WebGLEngine.sln` solution and build the project it contains.
   This should create the file `engine/wwtlib/bin/wwtlib.js`.

Otherwise, check out the latest continuous integration build of this repository, 
download the `scriptsharp` artifact, and copy the `wwtlib.js` file to the location
given above. (To find the artifact, go to the appropriate build in this project's 
[pipeline] on [Azure DevOps]). Under 'Related', select '9 published', and download 
artifacts for `scriptsharp`). If you want to change the C# code, you can file a pull 
request and access the artifacts associated with your pull request builds.

## Building the rest of the code

Besides the creation of the file `engine/wwtlib/bin/wwtlib.js`, virtually
everything in this repository is built using standard [Node.js]/[npm] tooling.
These tools must be installed before you can do anything else.

The multi-package structure of this repository is dealt with using [Lerna]. This
means that once you’ve checked out the code and install [npm], the setup
sequence is:

[Lerna]: https://lerna.js.org/

1. Run `git submodule update --init` to pull in needed Git submodules, namely
   the documentation theme in `docs/*/themes/wwtguide`.
1. Run `npx lerna bootstrap` to install all of the project dependencies and set
   up the necessary cross-links between individual packages in this repository.

Once setup is complete, the following commands will be useful:

- `npm run build` to build the subpackages
- `npm run lint` to lint the subpackages (using [eslint] with TypeScript extensions)
- `npm run test` to run the tests (mainly using [mocha] and [chai])
- `npm run doc` to build most of the documentation (using [TypeDoc]) — but see below

Running these commands from inside package subdirectories unfortunately *will
not* work due to the centralized `node_modules` directory we use with Lerna. To
run the `lint` command only for the `engine-types` submodule, run:

```
npx lerna run --scope @wwtelescope/engine-types lint
```

(The `--scope` argument can be a glob expression if you want to run on a subset
of packages.)


## Building the full documentation

Documentation is maintained in subdirectories of `docs/`. The documentation is a
Frankenstein combination of the autogenerated API documentation and narrative
material written in [CommonMark Markdown]. The final HTML is assembled with the
static site generator [Zola],

[CommonMark Markdown]: https://commonmark.org/
[Zola]: https://getzola.org/
[TypeDoc]: https://typedoc.org/

1. Zola is fast and self-contained and [ridiculously easy to
   install][install-zola].
1. The `npm run doc` command will install the autogenerated documentation into
   `docs/engine/static/`
1. Running `zola build` in a subdirectory of `docs` will assembled the final HTML
   into `docs/{subdir}/public/`.
1. The command `zola check` will check the narrative docs for broken links.
1. The command `zola serve` will serve the documentation using a local server
   with autoreload.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

This repository uses [Cranko] to automate release workflows. This automation is
essential to the smooth and reproducible deployment of the WWT web services.
