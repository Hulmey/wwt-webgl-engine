Basic data types relating to the WorldWide Telescope engine. The types here are
the ones that were historically easy to define independently of the actual
engine implementation, so that you could reference them without pulling in the
large body of engine code.

Check out the [module page](./modules.html) for an index of the types defined in
this package.
