In the [Getting Started](@/getting-started/_index.md) section, we discussed
different ways that you can use WWT in a project. In this tutorial, weâ€™ll dive
in with an introduction to the capabilities of WWT engine and common tasks you
might want to accomplish using it.

This tutorial will assume familiarity with the terminal, a code editor like [VS
Code], and core elements of the web platform like the JavaScript language and
CSS.
