The “[WebGL] engine” is the core renderer that powers the web-based forms of the
[WorldWide Telescope] software system. While it
underpins the [WWT web client] application, it is a reusable [TypeScript]
framework that can be embedded in webpages or your own applications. Like this!

This manual is the detailed reference on its usage and behavior.


## Historical Note

The Web manifestation of WWT has gone through several stages of evolution. These
stages include a [Silverlight] web client, a `<canvas>`-based “HTML5” version, a
“WebGL” iteration, and gradual improvements in its modularization. We won’t
intentionally break the pre-WebGL versions, but there are no guarantees that
they will continue functioning going forward.
