This package is the core WWT WebGL engine, transpiled from C# and decorated with
TypeScript annotations.

To work with the WWT engine in your own code, we recommended starting with a
higher-level module like [@wwtelescope/engine-helpers](../engine-helpers/) or
the [Vue]-based framework in [@wwtelescope/engine-pinia](../engine-pinia/).
However, regardless of which broad framework you use, if you interact with the
engine in detail you will likely end up using and referring to the definitions
in this module.
