# rc: minor bump

- Add support for panorama images (#117, @Carifio24)

[#117]: https://github.com/WorldWideTelescope/wwt-webgl-engine/pull/117


# @wwtelescope/embed 1.4.2 (2021-06-03)

- Loosen version requirements for Vue CLI tooling


# @wwtelescope/embed 1.4.1 (2021-01-27)

- Update v-tooltip, hopefully making Lerna a bit happier
- Correct temporary GitHub URLs in the package.json files


# @wwtelescope/embed 1.4.0 (2020-12-30)

- Large amounts of UI polish for tour playback. We now have UI controls, fixes
  for mobile, and a "letterbox" mode that ensures that the aspect ratio of the
  WWT canvas is reasonable when playing back tours.


# @wwtelescope/embed 1.3.0 (2020-10-09)

- Add new UI "controls" (to be distinguished from the "tools"): zoom buttons and
  a fullscreen toggle. Woo!


# @wwtelescope/embed 1.2.1 (2020-09-24)

- No code changes; just issuing a new release for the Cranko conversion.


# [1.2.0](https://github.com/pkgw/wwt-webgl-engine/compare/@wwtelescope/embed@1.2.0-beta.1...@wwtelescope/embed@1.2.0) (2020-06-12)

- Implement a very basic tour playback mode.


# [1.1.0](https://github.com/pkgw/wwt-webgl-engine/compare/@wwtelescope/embed@1.1.0-beta.0...@wwtelescope/embed@1.1.0) (2020-06-09)

- Add some tools to the embed user interface, including an opacity control for
  the foreground image and a background chooser.


# [1.0.0](https://github.com/pkgw/wwt-webgl-engine/compare/@wwtelescope/embed@0.1.1...@wwtelescope/embed@1.0.0) (2020-05-24)

- Version-only bump to 1.0 â€” we are going to try very hard to avoid breakage since we want
  to encourage people to run around sticking embed URLs everywhere they can think of.


## [0.1.1](https://github.com/pkgw/wwt-webgl-engine/compare/@wwtelescope/embed@0.1.1-beta.0...@wwtelescope/embed@0.1.1) (2020-05-24)

- New release to needed due to bug in continuous deployment infrastructure.


# [0.1.0](https://github.com/pkgw/wwt-webgl-engine/compare/@wwtelescope/embed@0.1.0-beta.4...@wwtelescope/embed@0.1.0) (2020-05-24)

**Note:** Version bump only for package @wwtelescope/embed
