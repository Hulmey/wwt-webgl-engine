/** A class for Vue components that wish to interact with a [[WWTComponent]]
 * through the Vuex state management system.
 *
 * Skip to [The WWT Vuex Interface](#the-wwt-vuex-interface) for a quick summary
 * of how WWT's state is exposed and controlled in Vuex.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * Vue applications are composed of multiple [components]. In a WWT-powered app,
 * one of those components will be a `<WorldWideTelescope>` component containing
 * the actual WWT rendering window. The other components of the app will wish to
 * monitor or alter the state of the WWT rendering window. The
 * [[WWTAwareComponent]] class provides a convenient framework for doing so.
 *
 * [components]: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html
 *
 * In particular, if your component’s TypeScript class [extends] this class, it
 * will automatically be set up with fields and methods allowing you to interact
 * with the WWT engine’s state. A minimal example:
 *
 * [extends]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html#inheritance
 *
 * ```vue
 * <template>
 *   <div id="app">
 *     <WorldWideTelescope wwt-namespace="mywwt"></WorldWideTelescope>
 *     <p class="coord-overlay">{{ coordText }}</p>
 *   </div>
 * </template>
 *
 * <script lang="ts">
 *   import { Component } from "vue-property-decorator";
 *   import { fmtDegLat, fmtHours } from "@wwtelescope/astro";
 *   import { WWTAwareComponent } from "@wwtelescope/engine-vuex";
 *
 *   @Component
 *   export default class App extends WWTAwareComponent {
 *     get coordText() {
 *       return `${fmtHours(this.wwtRARad)} ${fmtDegLat(this.wwtDecRad)}`;
 *     }
 *   }
 * </script>
 * ```
 *
 * This simple `App` component will display the coordinates of the current center
 * of the WWT view, and the coordinate readout will update automagically as the
 * user interacts with the view.
 *
 * ## Props
 *
 * Classes inheriting from [[WWTAwareComponent]] automatically define a prop
 * named [[wwtNamespace]]. This should be set to the namespace of the [Vuex
 * module] used to track the `<WorldWideTelescope>` component’s state — that is,
 * it should have the same value as that component’s own `wwtNamespace` prop.
 * The default value is `"wwt"`.
 *
 * [Vuex module]: https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/modules.html
 *
 * ## The WWT Vuex Interface
 *
 * Your [[WWTAwareComponent]] can monitor or manipulate the state of the WWT
 * renderer using the following interfaces, grouped by category. As a reminder,
 * in the Vuex paradigm, state is expressed in [state variables] and [getters],
 * and modified through instantaneous [mutations] and asynchronous [actions].
 *
 * [state variables]: https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/state.html
 * [getters]: https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/getters.html
 * [mutations]: https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/mutations.html
 * [actions]: https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/actions.html
